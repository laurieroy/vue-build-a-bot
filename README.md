# build-a-bot

This project was built following a [tutorial](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/vuejs-fundamentals) by Jim Cooper on Pluralsight. It demonstrates many of Vue2's capabilities.

A user see a robot and can select from a choice for new head, torso, arms, and base. Some items are on sale. The selected bot is sent to a cart, and total price displayed for checkout.
<!-- Bot price no longer displays in checkout.  -->
<!-- Also eslint is playing well w/prettier.  -->
